mcu: atmega644
optional: atmega programming header
--> put the atmega power on both sides
--> AVCC is not needed, code configures it to use VCC as source

transmitter:
PB0  (pin1) -> IR transmitter (clear) -> 120 ohm -> ground

IR hit indicator:
PB1 (pin2) -> LED -> 220 ohm -> ground

IR receiver:
ADC0 (PA0) (pin 40) -> IR receiver positive
IR positive -> 10K pullup to 5V -- give it some power
IR negative -> 220 ohm -> ground -- current limiting resistor
