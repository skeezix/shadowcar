Given: Analog servo

- the pulse period (frequency) is about 20ms (or about 50hz)
- lesser frequency probably works, but you have less torque as you're not refreshign the 'push' as often

- the pulse width is up to 2.0ms (approx) - it is possible a servo may allow longer pulse width for more reach?
- 90 deg servo: approx 1.5ms is neutral, and 1.0ms for one end and 2.0ms for the other
- hitec hs-422: 180 deg servo: approx 0.5ms is left, 1.5ms for middle, 2.5ms is far right

- the ending is not defined; 1.0 may be far clockwise, or far counterclockwise
- the middle is not well defined; it coudl be 1.5 is middle, or it could be off to one side with 80deg left one side and 100deg off the other

- if you over-push the servo past its mechanical end, you may burn it up
