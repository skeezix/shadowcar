Note on chip choice:
  -> atmega1284 seemed a better choice to start with (2 uart serials yay!) but toolchain pain made it
     annoying (unless having 1284p which I don't have handy.) Go back to old reliable 644 instead (only
     1 uart serial), but can talk to r-pi via i2c instead or bitbang it..)

todo:
  - linux read cam .. works at all grab images?
    - webcam has LED lights?
  - receiver is on micro or r-pi
  - read receiver from mcu
  - drive servo from mcu
  - range finder .. works?
  - protocol between r-pi and mcu

desirables:
  + voltage reader; add some resistor voltage dividers, feed battery into ADC to measure it
    : see: http://www.microbuilder.eu/Tutorials/Fundamentals/MeasuringBatteryVoltage.aspx  

raspberry-pi model b:
  - peripherals:
    - gpio pins:
    --> gpio serial 3.3V: http://www.elinux.org/RPi_Serial_Connection
  - goals:
    + lcd panel via composite
    + wifi remote control
    + communicate with mcu (2 way)
    + webcam
    - optional usb hub: -> 2.4ghz keyboard/thingy transceiver

  composite out: lcd
  usb1: wifi
  usb2: webcam
  i2c:
    -> mcu

atmega1284 (now atmega644):
  - actuals:
    receiver ch 1: PA0
    receiver ch 2: PA1
    serial rx: PD0
    serial tx: PD1
    isp pins: not impacting pin availability

  - burner pins:
    - reset 1
    - power 4
    - aref  1
    - xtal  2 --> total 8 burners
    - isp   3 (freebies)
  - peripherals:
    - usart pins: 1284->2 usarts!
    - PWM out pins:
    - ADC in pins:
    - i2c:
    - total IO pins:
  - goals:
    + ISP -> 3 pins (freebies)
    + text lcd -> 6 pins
      = p1 -> lcd RS pin 4
      = p2 -> lcd EN pin 6
      = p6 -> lcd D7 pin 14
      = p5    lcd D6 pin 13
      = p4    lcd D6 pin 12
      = p3    lcd D6 pin 11
    + RC receiver -> 1 pin
    - optional: speed sensor
    - optional: charger, charge sensors (heat, coltage, amperage)
    + 2 servo for camera -> 2 pins
    - optional 1 servo for range finder
    + range finder - 1pin
    + direct motor driver (sabertooth) -> simple serial mode .. 1 pin

  == total pins needed:
